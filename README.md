The Lebanese Government and Ogero have decided to switch landline phone numbers as follows:
- 01-XXX XXX to 21-XXX XXX
- 04-XXX XXX to 24-XXX XXX
- 05-XXX XXX to 25-XXX XXX
- 06-XXX XXX to 26-XXX XXX
- 07-XXX XXX to 27-XXX XXX
- 08-XXX XXX to 28-XXX XXX
- 09-XXX XXX to 29-XXX XXX

This app will help you migrate your contacts to the new format, and replace the 0 by 2.</br>
You can either select specific contacts to migrate, or select all contacts.</br>
You can also revert migrated numbers to the old format which starts with 0, in case you migrated some contacts by mistake.

This application is ad supported, and all ads revenue will be donated to [SOS Children's Village](https://www.sos.org.lb/).
